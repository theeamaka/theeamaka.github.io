## My Journey

As a tech enthusiast, and a naturally inquisitive person I have often wondered the right path to take to accomplish my goals in developing software that would make everyday tasks less challenging and more enjoyable.

In line with that need I have applied myself to different forms of skill acquisition in order to master programming languages that make my communication with computers easier and my learning path faster. This journey has made it possible to engage in activity that is helpful to the public and that I genuinely enjoy.
I am currently intermediate in web development and design and have completed projects using programming languages like java, python and javascript.
